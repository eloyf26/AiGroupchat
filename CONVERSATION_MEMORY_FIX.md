# Conversation Memory Fix Summary

## Problem
1. Agent messages were not being consistently stored in the conversation history, especially when users interrupted the agent mid-speech.
2. Async event handlers caused ValueError: "Cannot register an async callback with `.on()`"

## Root Cause
1. The LiveKit agent framework only calls `on_turn_completed` when an agent fully completes its turn. If a user interrupts, this callback doesn't fire, causing the agent's message to be lost.
2. LiveKit's event emitter requires synchronous callbacks, not async functions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Async Callback Error
- Converted async event handlers to synchronous functions
- Used `asyncio.create_task()` within sync handlers for async operations
- Follows LiveKit's event emitter requirements

### 2. Enhanced Message Capture
Implemented redundant message storage using LiveKit events:
- `conversation_item_added`: Primary capture when items are added to conversation (works for both complete and interrupted messages)
- `on_turn_completed`: Backup storage when turn completes normally
- Pre-storage of greeting messages

### 3. Interruption Handling
- Speech is now stored immediately when created, not after completion
- Handles user interruptions gracefully
- Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure no messages are lost

### 4. Improved Message Handling
- Better handling of different content types (lists, strings)
- Deduplication to prevent storing the same message multiple times
- Enhanced logging to track speech handle attributes

### 5. Backend Improvements
- Added owner_id tracking for Row Level Security
- Automatic owner_id detection for agent messages
- Better error handling and response logging

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Logs**: Run the agent with debug logging to see message flow:
   ```bash
   cd agent && LOGLEVEL=DEBUG ./run.sh
   ```

2. **Test Interruptions**: 
   - Start a conversation
   - Let the agent start speaking
   - Interrupt mid-sentence
   - Check if the partial message was stored

3. **Verify Storage**: Use the test script:
   ```bash
   ./test-message-tracking.sh
   ```

## Monitoring

Look for these log patterns:
- `[TURN] User turn completed` - User finished speaking
- `[TURN] Agent turn completed` - Agent response generated
- `[STORED] Agent response stored` - Message saved to database
- `[SPEECH] Agent speech committed` - Agent started speaking

## Future Improvements

1. **Stream-based Storage**: Store agent responses as they're generated in chunks
2. **Partial Message Recovery**: Capture and store partial messages on interruption
3. **Message Versioning**: Track edits and corrections to messages
4. **Real-time Sync**: Use WebSockets for instant message updates
