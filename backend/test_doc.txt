AI Group Chat Project Documentation

Overview:
AI Group Chat is an innovative educational platform that enables users to have natural voice conversations with AI agents. The system is designed to support various educational use cases including study groups, Socratic tutoring, and philosophical debates.

Key Features:
1. Real-time voice communication using WebRTC technology
2. Multiple AI agent personalities (Alex, Sophie, and Marcus)
3. Natural conversation flow with interruption support
4. Document-based knowledge retrieval (RAG)
5. Low-latency voice synthesis with ElevenLabs

Technical Architecture:
The system consists of three main components:
- Frontend: Next.js application for user interface
- Backend: FastAPI server for API endpoints and orchestration
- Agent: Python-based LiveKit agent with AI capabilities

AI Agent Personalities:
1. Alex (Study Partner): A friendly helper who explains complex topics clearly
2. Sophie (Socratic Tutor): Guides learning through thoughtful questions
3. Marcus (Debate Partner): Engages in philosophical discussions

Document Processing:
Documents are processed using LangChain's text splitters, creating chunks of 512 tokens each. These chunks are embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model and stored in a Supabase vector database for efficient similarity search.

Voice Technology:
The system uses Deepgram for speech recognition and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech synthesis. Each agent has a unique voice to enhance personality distinction.

Security Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase ensures users only access their own documents
- API authentication using LiveKit tokens
- Secure document upload with file type validation

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-agent conversations
- Advanced chunking strategies
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword search
- Real-time collaboration features
