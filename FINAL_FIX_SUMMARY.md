# Final Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **ValueError: Cannot register an async callback with `.on()`**
   - Converted async event handlers to synchronous functions
   - Used `asyncio.create_task()` for async operations within sync handlers

2. **AttributeError: 'ChatMessage' object has no attribute 'participant_identity'**
   - Removed attempt to access non-existent attribute
   - Using hardcoded "User" as participant name

3. **Missing agent messages when interrupted**
   - Using `conversation_item_added` event which fires even for interrupted messages
   - This event captures all messages added to the conversation context

## Implementation Details

### Message Storage Strategy
1. **Primary storage**: `conversation_item_added` event
   - Captures both complete and interrupted messages
   - Works for both user and agent messages
   - Fires reliably when messages are added to conversation

2. **Backup storage**: `on_turn_completed` callback
   - Stores messages when turns complete normally
   - Provides redundancy

3. **Deduplication**: 
   - Tracks last message and timestamp
   - Prevents duplicate storage within 2-second window
   - Separate tracking for user and agent messages

### Event Handler Pattern
```python
@session.on("event_name")
def handler(event):
    async def async_work():
        # Async operations here
    asyncio.create_task(async_work())
```

## Benefits
- No more async callback errors
- All messages are captured, even when interrupted
- Robust deduplication prevents duplicate entries
- Clear logging shows message flow
- Simplified architecture (removed non-working speech_created handler)

## Testing
The logs show the fix is working:
- `[STORED] Conversation item stored:` indicates successful message capture
- Both user and agent messages are being stored
- No more attribute errors
